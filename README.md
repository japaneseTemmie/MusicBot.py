# MusicBot.py
Feature-rich Discord music bot written in Python.

# Setup
First, go to discord.com/developers and set up a new application and a bot, also, make sure to check all priviliged intents in the Bot section.
Then, invite the bot to your server.
While creating a bot, save the bot token as it will be required later on.

Download the source code and extract to a directory of your choice.
Open a terminal window in that directory to install dependencies. A *venv* is recommended to isolate dependencies.

# Required dependencies
- discord (For interacting with the API)
- yt_dlp (For fetching tracks from YouTube)
- PyNaCl (Additional voice support for discord.py)

Use `pip install <dependency>` to install the required packages.

Audio playback also requires ffmpeg to be installed on the host machine.
On Debian based Linux distributions, you can install ffmpeg by typing `sudo apt install ffmpeg`.
You can test if ffmpeg is installed by typing `ffmpeg` in a command line, a help message should appear if installed correctly.

On Windows, ffmpeg must be downloaded, extracted and added to the PATH environment variable.

After installing required dependencies, you can optionally open client.py in a text editor to configure the bot. Most options are already configured with default settings.

# Configuring and running the bot

Create a file called "bot_token.txt" (case sensitive) in the bot's main directory and paste in your bot token at line 1 and nothing else.
Additionally, you can set REQUIRED_ROLE_NAME in client.py if you want to check for a specific role that the user must have before executing a command, default value is None, which means that
no checks will be made.

Example:

... Other client.py code

`REQUIRED_ROLE_NAME: str = "DJ"` # Will check for "DJ" role in the user who invoked the command's roles.

Then, to run the bot, type `python3 main.py` (If you created a _venv_ make sure to enter its environment and check packages before running this command).
The bot should then initialize everything and go online, which is confirmed if you see "Logged in as <yourbotusername>".
The bot is now listening for commands.

NOTE: This Discord music bot is mostly just a fun project and does not work across multiple guilds (servers). The bot is meant to operate in a single guild.

# Usage and features
Once the bot is online, send >musichelp (Substitute ">" with your custom prefix if defined in client.py) in a text channel to see all music features and usage help.
The bot also includes a small moderation class, its help menu can be shown with >modhelp.
